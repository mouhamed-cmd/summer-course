# Hands-On: Python Conditional Statements

These exercises focus on using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control program flow. You'll work with comparison operators, logical operators, and data types from Lesson 1 to make decisions in your code.  Write each exercise as a separate python script.

---

## Hands-On #1:

---

### Exercise 1: Check if a Number is Positive

**Goal**: Write a Python Script that asks a user for an integer number, and then checks if the number is positive using an `if` statement.


✅ *Check*: Should print "The number is positive" if the number is greater than 0.

---

### Exercise 2: Even or Od
d

**Goal**: Write a Python script that asks a user for an integer number.  Check if the number is even or odd using `if` and `else`.



✅ *Check*: Should print "Even" or "Odd" based on the number.

---

### Exercise 3: Age Category

**Goal**: Write a python script that asks a user for their age, and then uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` to print the correct category for the person by based on their age.

- Under 13: "Child"
- 13-19: "Teenager"
- 20-64: "Adult"
- 65+: "Senior"


✅ *Check*: Should print the correct category based on age.

---

### Exercise 4: Compare Two Numbers

**Goal**: Write a Python Script that asks a user for two numbers.  Compare the two numbers and print which is larger, or if they're equal.

```python
a = 10
b = 20
```

✅ *Check*: Should print "{first_number} is larger", "{second_number} is larger", or "The numbers are equal".

---

### Exercise 5: Grade Converter

**Goal**: Write a Python Script that asks a user for a numeric grade, and then converts a numeric grade to a letter grade and prints the letter grade.

- 90+: A
- 80-89: B
- 70-79: C
- 60-69: D
- Below 60: F


✅ *Check*: Should print the correct letter grade.

---

### Exercise 6: String Length Check

**Goal**: Write a Python Script that asks the user for an input string.  Then check if a string has more than 10 characters.  Print "Long string" if it is longer than 10 characters, print "Short string" if it is shorter.



✅ *Check*: Should print "Long string" if length is greater than 10, otherwise "Short string".

---

### Exercise 7: Logical AND Operator

**Goal**: Write a Python script that asks the user for a number.  Check if a number is between 10 and 20 (inclusive) using the `and` operator.  Print "Number is in range" if it is in between 10 and 20.  Otherwise it should print "Out of range."

```python
number = 15
```


+
✅ *Check*: Should print "Number is in range" if between 10 and 20, otherwise should print "Out of range".

---

### Exercise 8: Logical OR Operator

**Goal**: Write a python script that checks if a character is a vowel using the `or` operator.  Print "vowel" or "consonant" depending on the input.



✅ *Check*: Should print "Vowel" if the letter is a, e, i, o, or u, else "Consonant".

---

### Stretch:  Exercise 9: Leap Year Checker

### Stretch:  Exercise 10: Nested Conditionals - BMI Calculator

**Goal**: Write a Python Script that asks the user for their weight in kilograms and their height in meters.  Calculate BMI category using correct `if-elif-else` structure.

- BMI 25-29.9: "Overweight"
- BMI 30+: "Obese"

Formula: BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)²



✅ *Check*: Should calculate BMI and print the correct category.
